          "Block.one, the company behind blockchain platform EOSIO, has announced that they’re releasing latest update to the code, which is said to allow for much greater speeds across the network than previously seen. According to the company, EOSIO 1.6.0 has reached up to 35% better transaction processing speed in internal testing. \n\nEOSIO, a platform for the execution of smart contracts and the building of decentralized applications (dapps), claims to have current maximum speeds recorded on its blockchain at 3,996 transactions per second. Aside from the higher speed, the update also includes reductions in CPU costs and decreased latency, making for cheaper running of applications as well as increasing their responsiveness",
      desc2:
          "Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer said for the press release, “Our aim is to drive mass adoption of blockchain. As part of the community that continues to work on the EOSIO software and its corresponding advancements, we hope to play a leading role in the next generation of blockchains through our deep engineering talent and our dedication to a future of global commerce and communications based on blockchain. \n\nEOS, the EOSIO platform’s native token, is currently ranked 5th by market capitalization on coinmarketcap.com, worth USD 2.48 per coin.",

          "The fight for speed on the blockchain is hardly unique for EOSIO. In fact, most other smart contract platforms, such as NEO, Qtum and others are participating in the race. Also, Ethereum’s upcoming Constantinople upgrade boasts four Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), three of which target speed, efficiency and scalability.\n\nMeanwhile, QtumX, an enterprise-level blockchain system developed by the Qtum team, has recently announced that according to benchmark testing, they can handle more than 10,000 transactions per second. “[QtumX] aims to realize high TPS (Transactions Per Second) and low confirmation time of the blockchain, to make dapps applicable to more business scenarios. Meanwhile, we intend to minimize storage and network consumption, so as to reduce operating costs,” the team announced this week."),

          "Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance now lets their users buy crypto assets by using their Visa and MasterCard debit and credit cards, made available through the exchange’s partnership with payment processor Simplex.\n\nThe coins that will be available for purchase this way are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP).\n\nAs the benefits of using cards to purchase cryptocurrencies, the Binance team states in its press release: “Fast: Average 10-30 mins for cryptocurrency to reach your wallet; Low Fees: only 3.5% per transaction or 10 USD, whichever is higher; Convenient: Visa and MasterCard accepted.”",

          "Debt-incurring credit card usage in crypto has always been controversial. Perhaps most notably, top exchanges have gone back and forth on support. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, for example, stopped allowing credit card purchases in the US a year ago but, when it still allowed them, customers were found to have incurred additional charges. However, that exchange still accepts credit and debit cards for those outside the US, as well as bank account transfers.\n\nAnother big setback is that banks are unsure whether they want to allow their clients to use their cards for crypto purchases. Lloyds Bank in the UK, for instance, banned their clients from making crypto purchases last year, following in the footsteps of JP Morgan and Citigroup. Australia’s largest retail-aimed bank, The Commonwealth, also said it would not allow its customers to buy digital assets using Commbank credit cards “due to the unregulated and highly volatile nature of virtual currencies.”"),

      desc1:
          "Blockchain project Zilliqa (ZIL) has launched its mainnet, heralded the first ever successful implementation of a scaling technology called sharding on a blockchain.\n\n“Today, we are taking a leap towards our vision of enabling innovative blockchain-powered solutions to real-world problems,” Zilliqa CEO and co-founder Xinshu Dong wrote in a blog post. “With this launch, Zilliqa is now the first public blockchain platform to successfully implement sharding, to address one of the biggest challenges to mainstream blockchain adoption – scalability.”",
      desc2:
          "The launch of the Zilliqa mainnet means that sharding is possible in reality. This is also important for projects such as Ethereum, which is looking into sharding as one of the possible solutions to its scaling debate, although it is not expected on the Ethereum mainnet before 2020. With Zilliqa’s mainnet up and running, they may be lighting the way for other projects to implement this solution without forgoing security and decentralization while gaining scalability.\n\nAlthough there are many features that set Zilliqa apart from similar projects, sharding is considered by far the most important one, as the first live implementation of the technology. In general, sharding is a type of database partitioning that separates very large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards.",
      desc3:
          "In blockchain, sharding splits the work that the network has to do into smaller groups, called shards. Participants in the network (nodes) then establish consensus in those smaller groups, which makes transactions faster and cheaper than if they were processed by the entire network. In effect, it is a way of distributing the workload so that not every node has to do every task, like it happens with Bitcoin.\n\nBlockchain enthusiasts and developers can track the operations of the network via Zilliqa Explorer.\n\nHowever, the ZIL coin dropped sharply after the mainnet launch announcement, from around USD 0.018 before the news, to USD 0.017 after them. The price has recovered in the meantime, with a net decrease of around 0.9% in the past 24 hours (UTC 2:00 PM.) The coin is currently ranked 32nd by market capitalization."),

      title: "Blockstream Aims to Help Exchanges to Prove their Reserves",
      author: "By Tim Alper",
      time: "Yesterday",
      desc1:
          "Removing the need to trust anyone has been one of the biggest goals of cryptocurrencies. This should include cryptocurrency exchanges as much as any other party. That’s why major blockchain technology company Blockstream is building a tool called Proof of Reserve that allows an exchange to prove how many Bitcoin they could spend without needing to generate a “live” transaction or exposing themselves to the risks of moving funds\n\nThe idea behind Proof of Reserve is very simple, according to a blog post published by Blockstream. By using this tool, the exchange constructs a transaction made up of all their Bitcoin UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) and adds an extra invalid input - in case the transaction is broadcast to the network by mistake, the invalid input will force the network to reject the whole transaction, preventing possible spending of the exchange’s funds. Still, the transaction data exists and can be shared with anyone asking for it in order to verify reserves.",
      desc2:
          "The official blog post goes on to add, “Proof of Reserves is written in Rust [programming language,] and currently supports both the Bitcoin Core wallet and Trezor, with more integrations on the way (Ledger support coming soon!).” The team behind it is currently working on finding a way to disclose the sum of values without publicizing the value of individual UTXOs, which could possibly reveal too much information on each exchange’s financial operations.\n\nThe community also likes the idea of removing the need to trust exchanges without being provided proof. “Fantastic, really hope this gets picked up. Bitcoin hasn't seen exchanges do significant Proof of Reserves since right after the Mt Gox collapse in 2014,” tweeted Bitcoin fund Adamant Capital founder Tuur Demeester",
      desc3:
          "At the moment, Blockstream has already submitted a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) to the mailing list of Bitcoin developers and is waiting to receive feedback. Soon, the platform should be rolling out on Liquid, their inter-exchange settlement network linking together cryptocurrency exchanges and institutions around the world, where users can access a standard feature for proving Liquid Bitcoin (L-BTC) holdings.\n\nBut the Proof of Reserve solution is not a panacea. In a Twitter thread about the recent QuadrigaCX fiasco, blockchain architect Christopher Allen wrote, “Though I believe the loss of keys in this case to be a ruse, from my research for the #SmartCustody series of workshops a lot of what is being said by digital asset exchanges & custodians is security theater. Proof-of-Reserve is a good tool, but customers need demand more.”"),

          "More than four years after the infamous Mt. Gox incident, where approximately 850,000 bitcoins belonging to customers and the cryptocurrency exchange were announced to be missing and likely stolen, victims have been filing rehabilitation claims and are now waiting to be reimbursed. However, it seems that they might need to wait even longer, as two different entities are slowing down the process: cryptocurrency company CoinLab, headed by CEO Peter Vessenes, and former child actor and crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce.\n\nThe now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange has been awarded permission to begin the process for civil rehabilitation in June last year, by the Tokyo District Court. Among the claimants is also CoinLab with a claim for a whopping USD 15 billion (JPY 1.6 trillion), according to a photo of the claim shared by lawyer Daniel Kelman.",
      desc2:
          "Kelman is one of the many who lost their bitcoins in the Mt. Gox crash. He has been actively involved in the Gox case since 2013. He does not formally represent anyone and maintains that he is a creditor, with the best interests for creditors as motivation for his actions.\n\nCoinLab does not have a case, Kelman believes: “My bet is that CoinLab is holding out for an initial court ruling. The trustee will motion to have the CoinLab's claim/suit dismissed in court in a summary judgement motion. These motions are seldom granted and are only appropriate in cases where the result is obvious and the court's time not wasted hearing the facts.\n\n“He blew his chance in late 2010 by turning down an offer from Jed McCaleb (co-founder of Stellar) to take over Mt. Gox. Seven months or so later he came back trying but failing to assert an ownership stake in Mt. Gox after Bitcoin has soared from USD 1 to USD 30,” Kelman said.”",
      desc3:
          "Meanwhile, a new initiative dubbed Gox Rising is calling for a new, accelerated rehabilitation plan for creditors of Mt. Gox, with the long-term goal of rebooting the trading platform, and is led by crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce. He says that their long-term aim is to reboot the platform as a “Gox or Mt. Gox” exchange - to rehabilitate not only lost funds, but the brand name and domain itself. The rebooted platform would reportedly be non-custodial, to minimize security liabilities.\n\nKelman agrees: “Similar to CoinLab's Peter Vessenes, Pierce harbors feeling of a missed opportunity of which he cannot let go. He tried and failed to acquire Mt. Gox in 2014, getting only so far as a letter-of-intent (LOI) which is clearly not an enforceable agreement but which Pierce apparently wants to litigate over nonetheless.”"),
